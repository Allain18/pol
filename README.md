# pol
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Allain18/pol.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/Allain18/pol)

Command line calculator using [reverse polish notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation)

Decimal, hexadecimal, binary and octal number are supported

## Usage
As a command line tool: __pol__

```
~$ pol
Reverse polish notation calculator
>5 10 * dec
50
>0xA 0x6 + hex
0x10
>q //quit the program
~$
```

Instructions are [below](#list-of-commands)

pol can also be use as a module
```python 
import rpn_calc
cal = rpn_calculator.Calculator()
cal.evaluate("1 2 + dec")
# print 3
```

## Install
pol can be install from pip
```
pip install rpn-calc
```
If you want to install from a source distribution, extract the tarball and run the following command
```
python setup.py install
```

## Documentation
This README is the Documentation

## [Repo](https://github.com/Allain18/pol)
The code is on github

## Config file
You can write your own command

By default commands from file ~/pol.yml (if exists) are add to the calculator

You can add other files with the flag -f/--file

Config files are written in YAML

### Currently supported parameters
- shortcut: shortcut to commands (see example below)
- rounding: parameter used to round number (default: 0)

### Example of a valid config file
```YAML
shortcut:
 - double = 2 * # double the last value of the stack
 - 10* = 10 switch ** # same as 10 {x} **
rounding: 3
```
Command must be on the format {name_of_command = command}

## Options
```
usage: pol [-h] [-v] [-l] [--ignore-local-config] [-f FILE [FILE ...]]

A RPN calculator written in python
Support decimal, hexadecimal, binary and octal

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --version         show the version number and exit
  -l, --list            list all commands available and exit
  --ignore-local-config
                        don't add commands from ~/.pol
  -f FILE [FILE ...], --file FILE [FILE ...]
                        file with customs commands
```
